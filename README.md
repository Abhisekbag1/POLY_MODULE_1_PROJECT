## POLY_PROOF_MODULE_1_PROJECT

For this project, you will deploy an NFT collection on the Ethereum blockchain, Map the collection to Polygon, and Transfer assets over via the Polygon Bridge.Generate a 5-item collection using DALLE 2 or Midjourney
Store items on IPFS using pinata.cloud
Deploy an ERC721 or ERC1155 to the Goerli Ethereum Testnet
You should have a promptDescription function on the contract that returns the prompt you used to generate the images
Map Your NFT Collection using Polygon network token mapper. Note: this isnâ€™t necessary but helpful for visualization.
Write a hardhat script to batch mint all NFTs.

# Approve the NFTs to be transferred.
# Deposit the NFTs to the Bridge.
# Test balanceOf on Mumbai.
Deploy an ERC721 to the Goerli Ethereum Testnet.

## Getting Started And Compile Step by step

### Executing program

Download the codes by downloading the entire repository 

```shell

 npm install

```

### Deployment the ERC721 Contract:

``` shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli 
```
## Main Point:
After deploying the address will generate. So, copy that address into `contarctAddress.js` and also in `batchMint.js`

 
## Compile the command to batch-mint NFTs using the deployed ERC721 contract:

``` shell
npx hardhat run scripts/batchMint.js --network goerli
```

### Approved and Deposit NFTs to Polygon Mumbai

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/approvedDeposit.js --network goerli
```
